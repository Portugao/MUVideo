# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy MUVideoModule into your `modules` directory. Afterwards you should have a folder named `modules/MU/VideoModule/Resources`.
2. Initialize and activate MUVideoModule in the extensions administration.
3. Move or copy the directory `Resources/userdata/MUVideoModule/` to `/userdata/MUVideoModule/`.
   Note this step is optional as the install process can create these folders, too.
4. Make the directory `/userdata/MUVideoModule/` writable including all sub folders.
